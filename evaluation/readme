The evaluation scripts perform the evaluation of the Temporal Random Indexing (TR) algorithm on the UK Web Archive JISC dataset 1996-2013 against the Oxford English Dictionary API.

A) Evaluation of TRI:

A.1) create_word_lists.py *with parameter baseline="no"*: takes an input from TRI 
(.../tri/year/v2/ukwac_s20_year_cum_CPD_001_label.csv and ukwac_s20_year_point_CPD_001_label.csv) and, 
for every candidate word, selects it if it occurs in the list of 400,000 English terms .../tri/words_alpha.txt; 
for every candidate word selected this way, it looks up its corpus frequency in dict.sample.all and filters it at 100.

A.2) an algorithm queries OED API to get all words that changed meaning between 1996 and 2013 -->
 …/Evaluation/OED/oed.quotation and oed.sense 

A.3) compare_candidates_oed.py *with parameter baseline="no"*: For every candidate word that occurs in the list from A.1), uses OED list to check if 
there is a quotation dated on the year of its change point or the year before or the year after; if so, that’s a true positive 
--> Precision = # correct candidates in OED / # detected candidates; 
Recall = # correct candidates in OED / semantically-changed words in OED

B) Evaluation of baseline which declares any word and any year for which the time series from TRI  goes up to be a semantic
change candidate:

B.1) create_word_lists.py *with parameter baseline="yes"*: takes an input from the baseline 
(.../tri/year/ukwac_s20_year_point_CPD_baseline.csv and ukwac_s20_year_cum_CPD_baseline.csv) and, for every candidate word, 
selects it if it occurs in the list of 400,000 English terms .../tri/words_alpha.txt; 
for every candidate word selected this way, it looks up its corpus frequency in dict.sample.all and filters it at 100.

B.2) compare_candidates_oed.py *with parameter baseline="yes"*: For every candidate word that occurs in the list from B.1), 
uses OED list to check if there is a quotation dated on the year of its change point or the year before or the year after; 
if so, that’s a true positive 
--> Precision = # correct candidates in OED / # detected candidates; 
Recall = # correct candidates in OED / semantically-changed words in OED
