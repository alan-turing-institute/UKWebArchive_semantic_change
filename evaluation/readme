The evaluation scripts perform the evaluation of the Temporal Random Indexing (TR) algorithm on the UK Web Archive JISC dataset 1996-2013 against the Oxford English Dictionary API.

Evaluation of TRI:

1) create_word_lists.py: takes an input from TRI 
(.../tri/year/v2/….csv) and, 
for every candidate word, selects it if it occurs in the list of 400,000 English terms .../tri/words_alpha.txt; 
for every candidate word selected this way, it looks up its corpus frequency in dict.sample.all and filters it at 100.

2) an algorithm queries OED API to get all words that changed meaning between 1996 and 2013 -->
 …/Evaluation/OED/oed.quotation and oed.sense 

3) an algorithm extracts the corpus neighbours for all candidates

4) compare_candidates_oed-neighbours.py: For every candidate word that occurs in the list from A.1), uses OED list to check if 
there is a quotation dated on the year of its change point or the year before or the year after; if so, that’s a true positive 
--> Precision = # correct candidates in OED / # detected candidates; 
Recall = # correct candidates in OED / semantically-changed words in OED
It also calculates the overlap between the corpus neighbours of the candidates, and the words contained in the pre-processed OED definition+quotation text of the corresponding entry.
